# 🧠 Fingerprint Data Repository - Hackathon 2025

Welcome to the **Fingerprint Data Repository** created for the [PSB Hackathon 2025]. This repository contains a curated dataset of fingerprint images and metadata intended for **research**, **prototyping**, and **testing** biometric authentication systems.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The main goal of this repository is to support teams working on:

- Fraud detection  
- Impersonation prevention  
- Passwordless behavior-based authentication  

You can use this dataset to train biometric recognition models, test spoof detection, or validate identity-auth workflows.
